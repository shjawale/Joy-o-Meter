# Joy-o-Meter
Completed as part of CS224 coursework.

In this assignment I implemented a simple linear neural network that reads in text and uses pretrained embeddings to predict the happiness intensity of the text. I used PyTorch, HuggingFace “transformers” library for getting pretrained models, “pandas” for data loading, matplotlib for visualization. It was completed on both Google Colab and my local Linux machine.

When running the plot function, this is the plot I got:
